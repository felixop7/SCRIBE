What is scribe??
Scribe  is a open platform for enthusiast creators
It is an open source platform integrated in blockchain where an author can enjoy our secure nodes for publishing and being an editor node.
Basically, scribe is a web app built on react and django as front and backend along with the integration of blockchain. A registered author can publish their contents with ease and registered users can buy the contents. Along with that various publications(Gold, Silver, Bronze) are integrated with the use of NFTs with different prize tags. Ownership of a certain publication are further transferable to other users, again giving the authors extra credit for every transaction made. It's all about supporting Authors, Content writers and article publishers.

Even in the age of superior digital technology, a time-defying idea shouldn't be buried; rather, it should be embellished.
A person should never have their idea rejected because of — Favoritism/Nepotism — Capital/Funding — Experience, Academics, or Credibility.

Therefore, “Scribe” aims to give aspirational changemakers a platform to share their opinions, research, and creations. It assists them in locating mentors, partners, and potential investors who can assist them in making their idea a reality.

Because this platform is “open source” the recommendation system will correct these biases rather than encouraging paid entities in the recommendations of the users.

As “Scribe” uses a decentralized blockchain to verify the contents to be published, the favoritism and nepotism that surround publishing houses, funding/launching agencies, monarchs, and autocrats will be eliminated. If found guilty, the publishing node will be removed from the network.

One user who might be interested in the idea or work of another can get in touch, work together, and even invest, so this could be the major step toward crowdsourcing and creating significant projects or carrying out global research activities.

Additionally, after passing a particular threshold established by the platform, a user can mentor and assist other aspirant changemakers in growing in their careers. As soon as someone is a verification node, they can review submitted abstracts and take appropriate action.
To safeguard one's creative work's copyright, the platform only requests an abstract of the idea or content.
